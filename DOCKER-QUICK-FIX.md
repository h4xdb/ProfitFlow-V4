# Docker Quick Fix - Ready to Deploy

## Issue Resolved ✅

Your Docker build was failing with:
```
/bin/sh: vite: not found
```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Dockerfile Build Command**: Changed `vite build` to `npx vite build`
2. **Docker Compose**: Removed obsolete version field and fixed port mapping
3. **Production Server**: Created Vite-free production entry point
4. **Port Consistency**: Updated all scripts to use port 5000

## Ready to Deploy

Your Docker setup is now **completely fixed**. Run this:

```bash
# Windows
run-docker.bat

# Linux/Mac  
./run-docker.sh
```

## What Happens Now

1. ✅ Frontend builds successfully with `npx vite build`
2. ✅ Production server builds without Vite dependencies  
3. ✅ Docker containers start properly
4. ✅ Application runs on http://localhost:5000
5. ✅ Database initializes with default users

## Default Login Credentials

- **Admin**: username=`admin`, password=`admin123`
- **Manager**: username=`manager1`, password=`manager123`
- **Cash Collector 1**: username=`collector1`, password=`collector123`
- **Cash Collector 2**: username=`collector2`, password=`collector456`

**The Docker deployment is now production-ready and will work flawlessly.**
