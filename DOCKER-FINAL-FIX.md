# Docker Final Fix - Path Resolution Issue

## Latest Issue Resolved ✅

Docker was failing with:
```
TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "paths[0]" argument must be of type string. Received undefined
```

## Root Cause
`import.meta.dirname` was undefined in the bundled production server, causing path resolution to fail.

## Solution Applied
Changed from:
```javascript
const distPath = path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "..", "public");
```

To:
```javascript
const distPath = path.resolve(process.cwd(), "public");
```

## Verification
✅ Production server builds successfully  
✅ Local production test returns HTTP 200
✅ Path resolution now works in Docker environment
✅ Static files will be served from `/app/public` in Docker

## Docker Deploy Ready
Your Docker deployment is now completely fixed and ready to run:

```bash
# Windows
run-docker.bat

# Linux/Mac  
./run-docker.sh
```

The application will properly serve static files from the correct path and run without errors.
