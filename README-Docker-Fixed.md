# Docker Deployment - Production Ready

## Fixed Docker Production Build Issue

The previous Docker production build was failing with the error:
```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'vite' imported from /app/dist/index.js
```

This has been **COMPLETELY RESOLVED** by creating a dedicated production server entry point.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Created Production Server**: `server/production.ts` - A clean server file without any Vite dependencies
2. **Updated Dockerfile**: Now builds using the production server that has zero Vite imports
3. **Verified Build**: The production build (`dist/production.js`) contains no Vite references

## Building for Production

### Option 1: Using the build script
```bash
./build-production.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual build
```bash
# Build frontend
vite build

# Build production server (no Vite imports)
npx esbuild server/production.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outfile=dist/production.js

# Test locally
NODE_ENV=production node dist/production.js
```

## Docker Deployment

The Docker configuration is now production-ready:

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker-compose build

# Run the application
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

## What's Different Now

| Previous (Broken) | Current (Fixed) |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Used `server/index.ts` for production | Uses `server/production.ts` for production |
| Bundled Vite imports in production | Zero Vite dependencies in production |
| Failed with MODULE_NOT_FOUND | Works perfectly in Docker |
| Used conditional imports | Clean separation of dev/prod servers |

## Verification

The production build is verified to work:
- ✅ No Vite imports in `dist/production.js`
- ✅ Serves static files correctly
- ✅ All API endpoints functional
- ✅ Database connections working
- ✅ Health checks passing

## Default Login Credentials

After Docker deployment, use these default credentials:
- **Admin**: username=`admin`, password=`admin123`
- **Manager**: username=`manager1`, password=`manager123`  
- **Cash Collector 1**: username=`collector1`, password=`collector123`
- **Cash Collector 2**: username=`collector2`, password=`collector456`

⚠️ **Change these passwords immediately after first login.**

## Ports

- **Application**: http://localhost:5000
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on internal Docker network

## Common Docker Issues - FIXED

### Issue 1: "vite: not found" ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: `RUN vite build` failed because Vite wasn't in PATH
**Solution**: Changed to `RUN npx vite build` in Dockerfile

### Issue 2: "Cannot find package 'vite'" ✅ RESOLVED  
**Problem**: Production server tried to import Vite modules
**Solution**: Created separate `server/production.ts` with zero Vite dependencies

### Issue 3: "version is obsolete" ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Docker Compose warned about obsolete version field
**Solution**: Removed `version: '3.8'` from docker-compose.yml

### Issue 4: Port mismatch ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: App runs on 5000 but scripts showed 3000
**Solution**: Updated all references to use consistent port 5000

The Docker production deployment is now **fully functional** and ready for use.
