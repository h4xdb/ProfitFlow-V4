I want you to create a complete ERP web application in PHP (with MySQL database) to manage incomes and expenses for a Masjid.  

**Roles & Permissions:**  
1. **Admin** – Has all rights of both Manager and Cash Collector. Can also create users and assign roles.  
2. **Manager** – Can define tasks, create receipt books, set receipt ranges, assign tasks to receipt books, add expenses, verify calculations, publish reports publicly, and backup data.  
3. **Cash Collector** – Can only enter receipts assigned to them (within their receipt book number and range).  

**Workflow:**  
- The **Manager** creates a “Task” (e.g., Construction, Charity, etc.).  
- The **Manager** creates a **Receipt Book** with:  
  - **Manually assigned Book Number** (chosen by the Manager, must be unique).  
  - Task it is assigned to.  
  - Starting and Ending receipt numbers.  
  - Total number of receipts in the book.  
- The Manager assigns the Receipt Book to a **Cash Collector**.  
- **Cash Collector** enters data for each receipt:  
  - Receipt Number (auto-filled in sequence within book range).  
  - Giver Name (Mandatory).  
  - Address / House Number (Mandatory).  
  - Phone Number (Optional).  
  - Amount (Mandatory).  
- The system should track each receipt as part of its book and task.  

**Expenses Module:**  
- Manager can add different expense types dynamically (e.g., Electricity Bill, Salary, Maintenance).  
- Expenses should have:  
  - Date.  
  - Type.  
  - Amount.  
  - Notes (optional).  

**Calculations & Reporting:**  
- The system should calculate:  
  - Total Income (sum of all receipts).  
  - Total Expenses (sum of all expenses).  
  - Current Balance (Income – Expenses).  
- Manager can review all data and **publish** it.  
- Once published, it should be visible on a **Public Page** showing:  
  - All tasks with their income from each receipt book.  
  - All expenses with type and amount.  
  - Total Income, Total Expenses, and Current Balance.  

**Data Backup Feature:**  
- Admin and Manager should have an option to **download a full backup** of all system data locally to their device.  
- Backup format should be **MySQL database export (.sql)** or **CSV for each table** in a ZIP file.  
- Backup button should be available in their dashboard.  

**Other Requirements:**  
- Use PHP and MySQL.  
- Secure login for Admin, Manager, and Cash Collector.  
- Role-based access control.  
- Responsive, simple Bootstrap-based UI.  
- Public page should be read-only and accessible without login.  
- All IDs (Tasks, Receipt Books, Receipts) must be unique and properly linked in the database.  

Build the project fully functional with proper database schema, PHP scripts, and front-end pages.
