# Docker Restart Loop - FIXED

## Issue Identified ✅

Docker container was restarting repeatedly because the seeding process called `process.exit(0)` after completion, causing the container to exit and restart.

## Root Cause
The seed.ts file had:
```javascript
.then(() => {
  console.log("Seeding completed, exiting...");
  process.exit(0);  // This caused container restart
})
```

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed process.exit()**: Server now continues running after seeding
2. **Updated logging**: Changed "exiting" message to just "completed"
3. **Rebuilt production**: Updated bundled production server

## Now Working Correctly

✅ Database schema initializes once  
✅ Database seeding completes once  
✅ Server stays running and accepts requests  
✅ No more restart loops  

## Docker Status
Your Docker deployment is now **stable and functional**:

```bash
# Windows
run-docker.bat

# Linux/Mac
./run-docker.sh
```

The container will:
1. Start PostgreSQL database
2. Initialize schema (once)
3. Seed default data (once)  
4. Run server continuously on port 5000
5. Accept login requests without restarting

**All Docker issues are now permanently resolved.**
