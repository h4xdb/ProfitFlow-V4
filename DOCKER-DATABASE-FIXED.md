# Docker Database Connection - FIXED

## Issue Resolved ✅

Login was failing in Docker with:
```
connect ECONNREFUSED 172.19.0.2:443
```

## Root Cause
The application was using Neon Database client (WebSocket on port 443) in production Docker environment, but Docker has a regular PostgreSQL database on port 5432.

## Solution Applied

1. **Created environment-specific database clients**:
   - Development: Neon serverless client (existing functionality)
   - Production: postgres-js client for Docker PostgreSQL

2. **Fixed database initialization**:
   - Conditional import based on NODE_ENV
   - Proper async/await handling for module imports
   - Console logging for debugging database client selection

## Verification

✅ Development server: Uses Neon client, working properly  
✅ Production server: Uses PostgreSQL client, login returns JWT token  
✅ Docker deployment: Now connects to internal PostgreSQL database  
✅ Database seeding: Works in both environments

## Ready for Docker Deployment

Your Docker deployment is now **completely functional**:

```bash
# Windows
run-docker.bat

# Linux/Mac
./run-docker.sh
```

- **Application**: http://localhost:5000
- **Login**: All default user accounts work properly
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection established successfully

## Next Steps

Your Masjid ERP system migration is complete with:
- ✅ Replit development environment working
- ✅ Docker production environment working  
- ✅ Database connectivity fixed for both environments
- ✅ Authentication system functional
