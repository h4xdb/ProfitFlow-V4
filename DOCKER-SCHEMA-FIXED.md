# Docker Schema Issue - COMPLETELY RESOLVED

## Issue Fixed ✅

Docker login was failing with:
```
"relation \"users\" does not exist"
```

## Root Cause
Database schema wasn't being created in Docker production environment.

## Complete Solution Applied

1. **Added Schema Initialization**: Production server now runs `drizzle-kit push` before starting
2. **Added Database Seeding**: Automatically creates default users and categories
3. **Updated Dockerfile**: Includes drizzle-kit in production for schema management
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling if schema already exists

## What Happens Now in Docker

1. ✅ Container starts and initializes PostgreSQL database
2. ✅ Application pushes database schema using drizzle-kit
3. ✅ Seeds database with default users and categories
4. ✅ Server starts and accepts login requests
5. ✅ Authentication works with all default accounts

## Verified Working

- Development: ✅ Login working
- Production: ✅ Login returning JWT tokens
- Docker: ✅ Schema creation + seeding + authentication

## Ready for Full Docker Deployment

Your complete ERP system is now production-ready:

```bash
# Windows
run-docker.bat

# Linux/Mac
./run-docker.sh
```

**All Docker issues have been permanently resolved.**
